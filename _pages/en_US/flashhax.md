FlashHax is an exploit for the Wii that is triggered by using the Internet Channel. Unlike other exploits, this doesn't require an SD card.

#### Requirements

* A Wii with an Internet connection
* The Internet Channel

#### Instructions

1. Open up the Internet Channel on your Wii.
    ![Internet Channel Wii Menu](/images/exploits/flashhax/internet-channel-start.png)
1. Go to flashhax.com in the browser and select the correct region for your console.

1. Bookmark the web page, by clicking the star button and pressing `Add Favorite`.

1. Open the site from the bookmark. It'll then proceed to download and load the HackMii Installer. It may take some time as it is downloading the installer over the Internet.

If the HackMii Installer doesn't load and it instead freezes (you can't move your cursor), please restart your Wii and repeat step 4 until it works. It might take multiple tries, so be persistent!

If you still can't get it to load, try deleting your cookies or save data for the Internet Channel.

If after several tries Flashhax still does not work, you should try a [different exploit](get-started) instead.
