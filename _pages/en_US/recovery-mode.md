Recovery Mode is a last resort method for recovering your Wii console from a brick before resorting to hard-modding and manual NAND programming. This mode was accessed by Nintendo employees in the factory by the usage of a special dongle, but the input needed to access it can easily be replicated in the present with a GameCube controller. Essentially, Recovery Mode puts a Wii Menu in a state where programs can be executed from a disc, including some retail games. This guide will instruct you on how to recover from some bricks using it.

#### Requirements

+ A GameCube controller
+ If the Diagnostic Disc Check was previously removed with Priiloader, or if a drive chip is on hand:
    + Super Smash Bros. Melee (Smash Stack)
    + Any other exploited Wii game, with the current exploit game save on the console (see [Legacy Exploits](legacy-exploits))
+ If the Diagnostic Disc Check was not previously removed with Priiloader, and no drive chip is on hand:
    + Super Smash Bros. Melee (Smash Stack)
+ An original revision Nintendo Wii (Family Edition Wiis will not work)
+ A Windows/Mac OS/Linux PC with an Internet connection
+ An SD Card formatted to Fat32

#### Preparation

#### Method I - Recovery Menu to Smash Stack

#### Method II - Recovery Menu to Bluebomb
