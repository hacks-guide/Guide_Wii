{% include toc title="條目內容" %}

This guide is intended to be the last you will ever need when it comes to theming on the Wii, not only providing instructions for the Wii Menu through MyMenuifyMod, but also with themes on WiiFlow Lite, USB Loader GX, and The Homebrew Channel. Additionally, forwarders are covered.

### Are you tired of the boring, plain white theme on your Wii Menu, and want a cool theme instead? This tutorial will help you get a new theme for your Wii Menu!

DO NOT CONTINUE WITH THIS GUIDE UNLESS YOU HAVE ADEQUATE BRICK PROTECTION, SPECIFICALLY [BOOTMII](bootmii) AND [PRIILOADER](priiloader)!
{: .notice--danger}

csm-installer has built in safety features to prevent from installing bad or corrupt Wii Menu themes, so please opt to use it instead of other theme installation homebrew.
{: .notice--warning}

Do not use any other version of ThemeMii than the one linked here, as ThemeMii Mod allows you to make a theme for Wii Menu version 4.3, other versions may not.
{: .notice--warning}

Only install themes on your Wii that have been formatted specifically for its version and current region. Installing themes from the wrong version or region on your Wii will cause a [brick](bricks#theme-brick). This tutorial will tell you how to create a .csm file that is safe to install.

Before proceeding, it helps to know the difference between .MYM and .CSM as file formats when used in Wii Menu theming. While the MYM is made by the theme creator which can then be shared around, the CSM is the result from building a MYM into a system menu. In other words, MYM mainly just holds assets - the actual system menu itself that needs to be installed comes seperate.

* There are other resources for Wii Menu themes, but they might be in csm form (ready to install on the Wii). If the csm doesn't match the version and region of your Wii Menu, try to convert it to mym with ThemeMii Mod, and then convert it back to csm with the instructions here using the version and region of your Wii Menu.

### Wii Theme Team Creations v2

Unfortunately, because of the codebase difference between the original WiiFlow and the newer WiiFlow Lite, themes are sparse - in fact, only one theme could be found that confidently works on the newer version. The instructions for installing that theme are below.

#### 第一節 — 尋找主題

* If you get an error saying "The system files are corrupted" or a black screen, don't panic as long as you installed Priiloader. Turn off your Wii, then hold down the RESET button down and turn on your Wii. You should be able to boot into the Priiloader menu, where you have some options to fix your Wii Menu. One of the options is to launch the Homebrew Channel, where you can launch MyMenuify Mod and press a button to download and install the original Wii Menu theme.

### USB Loader GX Theming

#### 操作說明

* 一台 Wii
* Insert your SD card or USB drive into your Wii.
* [USB Loader GX](wii-loaders#usb-loader-gx)
* You probably will pick the download link that says 4.X, that means the theme will work on version 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the Wii Menu.
* Some themes have different links for different regions, so pick the one corresponding to your Wii's region.

#### Instructions

1. Download a theme `.zip` file from the website linked above, or anywhere else you can get a proper theme.
1. Unpack the `.zip` file's contents into the `apps\usbloader_gx` directory on the storage device where you installed USB Loader GX.
1. After an introduction message, it will ask you what IOS you want to use in the app. If you have [installed cIOS](cios), use `IOS249`, or else use `IOS58`. If the former gives an `Exception DSI occurred!` error, press Reset on the Wii console, launch it again, then try `IOS250`. It might take a couple attempts to reload the IOS.
1. Start USB Loader GX, go to the `Settings` menu, and then go to `Theme Menu`.
1. Open the theme and install it.

### App Forwarders

App forwarders can add a bit of extra flair to your Wii Menu - but be careful with them as bad forwarders can cause a [banner brick](bricks#banner-brick). Generally, you can find forwarders on places like [GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-forwarder-repository.588781/) for popular apps such as emulators. Since forwarders come in a .WAD format, the process of installing them is as simple as normal usage with [YAWM ModMii Edition](yawmme).
