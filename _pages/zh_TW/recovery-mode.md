Recovery Mode is a last resort method for recovering your Wii console from a brick before resorting to hard-modding and manual NAND programming. This mode was accessed by Nintendo employees in the factory by the usage of a special dongle, but the input needed to access it can easily be replicated in the present with a GameCube controller. Essentially, Recovery Mode puts a Wii Menu in a state where programs can be executed from a disc, including some retail games. This guide will instruct you on how to recover from bricks (especially Korean Kii/Error 003) with it.

#### Requirements

+ A GameCube controller
+ If the Diagnostic Disc Check was previously removed with Priiloader, or if a drive chip is on hand:
    + Super Smash Bros. Brawl ([Smash Stack](legacy-exploits#smash-stack)) OR
    + Any other exploited Wii game, with the current exploit game save on the console (see [Legacy Exploits](legacy-exploits)) OR
    + Any retail game, and access to the [Bluebomb](bluebomb) exploit
+ If the Diagnostic Disc Check was not previously removed with Priiloader, and no drive chip is on hand:
    + Super Smash Bros. Brawl ([Smash Stack](legacy-exploits#smash-stack))
+ An original revision Wii (Family Edition Wiis will not work due to the lack of GameCube ports - otherwise you must solder some on)
+ A Windows/macOS/Linux PC with an Internet connection
+ An SD Card formatted to FAT32

#### Preparation

In order to hold down all 4 individual D-Pad buttons on a GameCube controller, you may be required to take the casing apart.

First of all, verify that your Wii can boot into Recovery Mode *at all*. This involves taking a GameCube controller, plugging it into the fourth controller port on a Wii, and simultaneously holding down the 4 individual D-Pad buttons on boot. If everything goes right, you should see a screen similar to the above. Bear in mind that if you are on a System Menu version on 2.0 or prior, you will not see a version number display at all, and you will not be able to boot from discs.

#### Method I - Recovery Menu to Smash Stack

#### Method II - Recovery Menu to Save Game Exploit

#### Method III - Recovery Menu to Bluebomb
