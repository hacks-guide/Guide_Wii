<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
cIOS (Custom IOS) are IOS that are patched to allow custom functionality. While [cIOS](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Custom_IOS) has largely been supplanted by AHBPROT, which gives complete hardware access, it still has useful applications. You can now use homebrew such as <a href="usbloadergx">USB Loader GX</a> and <a href="wiiflow">WiiFlow</a>. You can skip this process if you want, but generally it extends your Wii with little to no downsides.
