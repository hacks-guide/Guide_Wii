{% include toc title="條目內容" %}

You can now use the Homebrew Channel to launch homebrew apps. Open Shop Channel is a one-stop shop for downloading homebrew, which you will learn how to install further in this guide. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provide brick protection.

BootMii can be installed in two ways: directly to a part of the Wii bootloader called boot2, and via an IOS. BootMii under boot2 is preferred as it provides extended brick protection, but Wiis with a vulnerable boot2 are considerably rarer, having been manufactured before 2009. If BootMii says that it `can only be installed as an IOS`, that's normal.

### Required Reading

The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

Here's a tip - when installing homebrew applications on your SD Card or USB drive, your folder structure should look like this:

```
💾 SD Card or USB Drive
| ╸📁 apps
    | ╸📁 AppName1
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
    | ╸📁 AppName2
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
```

`AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. `AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. Do not nest multiple `apps` folders inside the `apps` folder itself.

Tip: You can tell if a Wii has BootMii installed as boot2 if your disc drive flashes very briefly, only after the immediate flash that happens when you press the POWER Button.
