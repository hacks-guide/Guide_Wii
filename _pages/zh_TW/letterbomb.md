1. On your Wii, return to the Wii Menu and then open the Wii Message Board.
1. Load the red letter with a bomb icon.
    + Ensure the date on your Wii is correct, otherwise you might be unable to find the letter.
    + In various scenarios, you may need to look at the previous or next day to find it.
    + If you don't see the red letter, check if any errors appear in the SD card section of `Data Management`. If you don't see the red letter, check if any errors appear in the SD card sections in `Data Management`. If any do, there may be an issue with the SD card format or the Wii’s SD card reader.
    + If your Wii freezes after clicking on the letter, you most likely chose the wrong system menu region for LetterBomb. Go back to Step 2 and verify that you chose the right region.
    + If all is correct and there is freezing, keep on trying until it works.
