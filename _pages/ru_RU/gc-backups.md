{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

This guide provides instructions on how to manage your GameCube backups, using GameCube Backup Manager. It functions similar to [Wii Backup Manager](wii-backups#using-wii-backup-manager).

### Requirements

* An SD card or USB drive
* [GameCube Backup Manager](https://github.com/AxionDrak/GameCube-Backup-Manager/releases)

To play multiple games, it is recommended to use an external hard drive for your Wii. Any external hard drive found on most modern marketplaces should work with your Wii.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32. Do not format it as other types such as NTFS, exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter being an outdated filesystem for storing Wii games.

1. Click on the `Files (Destination)` tab, then select the `Inactive` option from the dropdown menu. This will allow you to choose the drive where you want to transfer the game. Select the appropriate drive letter from the list.

1. Next, go back to the `Files (Source)` tab, select the game you want to transfer, and then click either `Install Game (1:1)` or `Install Game (Scrub)`.

Selecting `Install Game (Scrub)` will remove unnecessary data from the game, reducing the game's file size. For some games this can be a major reduction, for example with Animal Crossing - going from 1.3GB to around 26MB.
