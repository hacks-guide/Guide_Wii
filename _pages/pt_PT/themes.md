title: "Installing Wii Menu Themes"

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

This guide is intended to be the last you will ever need when it comes to theming on the Wii, not only providing instructions for the Wii Menu through csm-installer, but also with themes on WiiFlow Lite, USB Loader GX, and The Homebrew Channel. Additionally, forwarders are covered.

### Section I - Finding a Theme

DO NOT CONTINUE WITH THIS GUIDE UNLESS YOU HAVE ADEQUATE BRICK PROTECTION, SPECIFICALLY [BOOTMII](bootmii) AND [PRIILOADER](priiloader)!
{: .notice--danger}

csm-installer has built in safety features to prevent from installing bad or corrupt Wii Menu themes, so please opt to use it instead of other theme installation homebrew.
{: .notice--warning}

Do not use any other version of ThemeMii than the one linked here, as ThemeMii Mod allows you to make a theme for Wii Menu version 4.3, other versions may not.
{: .notice--warning}

Only install themes on your Wii that have been formatted specifically for it, and its current region. Installing themes from the wrong region or version on your Wii will cause a brick. This tutorial will tell you how to create a .csm file that is safe to install.
{: .notice--danger}

Before proceeding, it helps to know the difference between .MYM and .CSM as file formats when used in Wii Menu theming. While the MYM is made by the theme creator which can then be shared around, the CSM is the result from building a MYM into a system menu. In other words, MYM mainly just holds assets - the actual system menu itself that needs to be installed comes seperate.

+ https://gbatemp.net/download/categories/other-files.166/
+ [Wii Themer](http://www.wiithemer.org/) (online theme builder for specific versions and regions, ready to install .csm themes)

#### Requirements

* Wii Theme Team Creations v2
* An SD card or USB drive
* Below are some links to themes.
* [csm-installer](https://oscwii.org/library/app/csm-installer)
* [ThemeMii Mod](/assets/files/New_ThemeMii_MOD.zip)

#### Section II - Building the Theme

If you don't want to go through the hassle of using an external program to build a theme, you can also download a prebuilt theme from Wii Themer and skip to [Theme Installation](themes#theme-installation).

1. Once you downloaded the theme you want and double-checked you got the right one, extract the .zip file for ThemeMii Mod and open the application.
1. Go to `Tools` > `Download Base App` > Version of your Wii Menu > Region of your Wii Menu
1. A dialog box will pop up asking you to enter in a value to create a key. Enter in what it says, it will create a key that will be used to decrypt the Wii Menu contents from Nintendo's servers.
1. A file selection box will ask you where to save the .app file (that is the Wii Menu content file it downloaded). Save it to the directory where ThemeMii is in.
1. Go to `File` > `Open`, then browse for where your .mym file is.
1. Press `Create csm`, then browse for a directory you want to save the theme in. Give it a moment to build the theme.
1. A dialog box will pop up asking you if you want to save the .mym. Press `No`.

#### Section III - Installing the Theme

1. Extract the csm-installer `.zip` file to the root of your SD card or USB device.
1. Create a new directory on your SD card or USB device called `themes` if it does not already exist.
1. Copy your `.csm` file to the `themes` directory.
1. Insert your SD card or USB drive into your Wii, and launch the Homebrew Channel.
1. Launch csm-installer, and wait for it to load.
1. Select the theme you would like to install with `A`. Be absolutely sure at this point that you have downloaded the correct theme for your system menu version and region.
1. Press `+` to install the theme.
1. Highlight the theme you want to install, then press A. Give it a moment to install the theme, then press any button to go to the Wii Menu. Hopefully, the theme installed correctly. If all goes well, you will have a result similar to the below!

#### Instructions

1. Have the storage device that holds WiiFlow Lite connected to your PC.

### App Forwarders

App forwarders can add a bit of extra flair to your Wii Menu - but be careful with them as bad forwarders can cause a [banner brick](bricks#banner-brick). Generally, you can find forwarders on places like [GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-forwarder-repository.588781/) for popular apps such as emulators. Since forwarders come in a .WAD format, the process of installing them is as simple as normal usage with [YAWM ModMii Edition](yawmme).
