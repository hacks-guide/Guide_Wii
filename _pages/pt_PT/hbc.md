title: "Homebrew Channel and BootMii Installation"
---

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

BootMii can be installed in two ways: directly to a part of the Wii bootloader called boot2, and via an IOS. BootMii under boot2 is preferred as it provides extended brick protection, but Wiis with a vulnerable boot2 are considerably rarer, having been manufactured before 2009. In most cases, installing BootMii as IOS should be fine, as long as you also install [Priiloader](priiloader).

If you do not have an SD card, you cannot install nor use BootMii, and therefore will not be able to utilize any of the mentioned benefits. <br> You can always [install it at a later date](hackmii).

### Instructions

1. Your console should be powered on and showing the HackMii Installer from the previous part of the guide.
    + You will see a scam warning screen.

### Required Reading

You can now use the Homebrew Channel to launch homebrew apps.

Here's a tip - when installing homebrew applications on your SD Card or USB drive, your folder structure should look like this:

```
💾 SD Card or USB Drive
| ╸📁 apps
    | ╸📁 AppName1
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
    | ╸📁 AppName2
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
```

`AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. Do not nest multiple `apps` folders inside the `apps` folder itself.

[Continue to making a NAND Backup using BootMii](bootmii)<br> Making a NAND backup with BootMii at this point is highly recommended.

Tip: You can tell if a Wii has BootMii installed as boot2 if your disc drive flashes very briefly, only after the immediate flash that happens when you press the POWER Button.
