This guide provides different means of regaining WiiConnect24 functionality on your console. Although not at all nessecary, it is a "nice to have" feature that was originally used for online connectivity in certain applications on the console. These apps include the Forecast/News Channel, Nintendo Channel, Check Mii Out Channel, some Japan-exclusive channels, and more. Please bear in mind, the functionality you gain depends entirely on what service(s) you use.

### Service Overview

#### Note about service compatibility:
Both services listed below are compatible with one another and can be loaded on the same console. With this said, it should be noted that when installing one channel over the other (WiiLink's Forecast Channel over RiiConnect24's Forecast Channel for example), the channel you are installing will overwrite the old one.
