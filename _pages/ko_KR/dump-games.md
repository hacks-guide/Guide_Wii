1. When prompted, select `Yes` to download the redump.org DAT files.
    + This is required to ensure that the resulting dumps are clean/accurate.

    You may get an exception error if you do this. If so, restart your Wii and try again - but if you continue to get exception errors, dump the disc and verify the checksum in Dolphin instead if needed.

### Dumping a Wii Disc

As of v2.1.2 of CleanRip, there is an option to auto-detect whether or not the disc you have is dual layer. If you are on an earlier version, or just want to verify that the correct option is being selected, you can check [this list](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Dual_Layer_Disc_games) to see if your game is a dual layer disc.

If you get an unrecovered read error, ensure that the disc you are attempting to dump is clean and can be properly read by the console. Even though you may be able to play the game disc normally, you may still get this error. If the error persists, try to dump another disc and see if the same error happens.

1. When prompted, select if your disc is an unlicensed Datel disc. If unsure, select `No`.

1. When the dump finishes, you should see a screen with the MD5 checksum of your disc, compared to the Redump DAT if you enabled it.
