While [cIOS](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Custom_IOS) has largely been supplanted by AHBPROT, which gives complete hardware access, it still has useful applications. For example, this enables the functionality of USB loaders like USB Loader GX and WiiFlow, alongside other pieces of homebrew like SaveGame Manager GX. You can skip this process if you want, but generally it extends your Wii with little to no downsides.

If you have a Wii mini, install [this cIOS](cios-mini) instead. Attempting to install any other cIOS on a Wii mini won't work.

### Requirements

* A Wii
* An SD card or USB drive
* [d2x cIOS Installer](/assets/files/d2x-cios-installer.zip)

Ensure that if you are using an SD card, the lock switch is in the unlocked position, otherwise you will not be able to select the correct options in the installer.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Downloading

If your Wii has an Internet connection, you may skip this section.
{: .notice--warning}

If you are not on Windows, you may download & run [this script](/assets/files/d2x_offline_ios.sh), and it will download the WAD files for you.

1. Power off your console.
1. Insert your SD card or USB drive into your computer.
1. Download, extract, and run [NUS Downloader](https://github.com/WiiDatabase/nusdownloader/releases/latest/download/NUSD-Mod-NUS-Fix.zip).
1. Copy all files from the NUS Downloader `.zip` to a folder on your computer.
1. Run `NUS Downloader.exe`.
1. Select "Database", "IOS", then "IOS38", and select "v4123".
    + Ensure that "Pack WAD" is checked.
    + *Don't* check "Patch IOS". That is the cIOS Installer's job.
1. Click `Start NUS Download!`.
1. Repeat the step 2 & 3 for `IOS56 v5661`, `IOS57 v5918` and `IOS58 v6175`.
1. Once you have downloaded all four IOS, there will be a folder named `titles` in the same folder as the NUS Downloader.
1. <br/> Open the folder and navigate through them until you locate the four WAD files you downloaded.
1. You can now use homebrew such as [USB Loader GX](usbloadergx) and [WiiFlow](wiiflow).
    + This must be the same device containing the d2x cIOS Installer.

The WAD files should be on your SD card like this: ![](/images/cios/d2x_offline_ios.png)
