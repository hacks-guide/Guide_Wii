title: "Creating Wii Game Shortcuts"

{% include toc title="Tabla de contenido" %}

Do you use a Wii backup loader and want to create game shortcuts to launch them on your Wii Menu? Then try WiiGSC (Wii Game Shortcut Creator), previously known as Crap.

In the case of a brick, [installing Priiloader is a must](/priiloader). Also, install BootMii (as Boot2 if you have an early Wii). Installing brick protection along with following the guide correctly should keep you safe from bricks. DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HAVE INSTALLED PRIILOADER AND BOOTMII!
{: .notice--warning}

Do NOT make a shortcut for the games "Mario Party 9" or "A Boy and His Blob". It will brick your Wii.

The Wii Menu is limited to 48 channels, not including existing system channels.

If you are on vWii, use the [Wiiforwarder2vWii](https://gbatemp.net/download/wiiforwarder2vwii-wii-forwarder-to-vwii-wii-u-forwarder-converter-beta-version.37254/) tool to convert the WAD for use on the vWii.

If you get an error saying "The system files are corrupted", don't panic as long as you installed Priiloader. Turn off your Wii, then [boot into Priiloader](priiloader#section-iii---entering-priiloader) using one of the available methods for your console. Enter the Homebrew Channel and launch your WAD manager to uninstall the WAD. If priiloader was not installed, proceed to [BlueBomb](bluebomb).
