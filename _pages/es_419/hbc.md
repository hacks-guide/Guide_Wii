title: "Homebrew Channel and BootMii Installation"

{% include toc title="Tabla de contenido" %}

The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

BootMii can be installed in two ways: directly to a part of the Wii bootloader called boot2, and via an IOS. BootMii under boot2 is preferred as it provides extended brick protection, but Wiis with a vulnerable boot2 are considerably rarer, having been manufactured before 2009. Install BootMii as IOS, even if you already installed BootMii as boot2 in the previous step.

If you do not have an SD card, you cannot install nor use BootMii, and therefore will not be able to utilize any of the mentioned benefits. You can always install it at a later date.

### Required Reading

When at the HackMii installer, you are able to install the Homebrew Channel and BootMii.

Here's a tip - when installing homebrew applications on your SD Card or USB drive, your folder structure should look like this:

```
💾 SD Card or USB Drive
| ╸📁 apps
    | ╸📁 AppName1
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
    | ╸📁 AppName2
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
```

`AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. Do not nest multiple `apps` folders inside the `apps` folder itself.

Tip: You can tell if a Wii has BootMii installed as boot2 if your disc drive flashes very briefly, only after the immediate flash that happens when you press the POWER Button.
