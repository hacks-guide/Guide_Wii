### What is "homebrew"?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)) refers to software not authorized by Nintendo. This can include games, utilities, emulators and much more!

Here's a list of things you can do using homebrew.

+ Backup and restore copies of your Wii system memory (NAND) using [BootMii](bootmii).
+ Protect your Wii from bricks using [Priiloader](priiloader) and BootMii.
+ Download new homebrew apps with the [Homebrew Browser](hbb)
+ Patch game disc contents (allowing you to load game modifications) using [Riivolution](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Riivolution).
+ Install themes to your Wii Menu using [MyMenuify](themes).
+ Back up your discs with [CleanRip](/dump-games) and installed games and titles with [YABDM](dump-wads)
+ Install a USB Loader like [WiiFlow](wiiflow) or [USB Loader GX](usbloadergx) to launch all your favorite titles from a USB storage device and more.
+ Back up and restore your save files with [SaveGame Manager GX](https://wiidatabase.de/downloads/wii-tools/savegame-manager-gx-beta/)
+ Restore discontinued online services, such as [WiiConnect24](riiconnect24) & [Nintendo WFC services](wiimmfi).

### What does the guide install?

This guide aims to do the following, including optional sections:

+ Modify your Wii using one of many exploits, with the end goal of reaching the HackMii installer
+ Install BootMii and the Homebrew Channel
+ Make a backup of critical system files
+ Install Priiloader
+ Install the Open Shop Channel
+ Recommended homebrew to use on your Wii
+ Turn your Wii into a media player with [WiiMC](https://oscwii.org/library/app/wiimc-ss).

### What should I know before starting?

+ Running homebrew on your Nintendo Wii can be done for free by exploiting bugs in Wii's software. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is likely attempting to [scam you](https://hbc.hackmii.com/scam).
+ This guide works on all system menu versions depending on the exploit, but **it is recommended that you update to 4.3 (the latest firmware)** if possible.
+ **This guide applies to retail/consumer Wiis ONLY!** This means that development units are not covered, nor is the Wii U's vWii.
+ Depending on what you intend to do with your modded Wii, you may have to make some modifications to the system memory that have a risk of bricking (rendering the console inoperable). As long as you follow this guide exactly, you should be fine, but for general brick prevention tips see [this](bricks#brick-prevention) page.
+ The differences between the Wii and Wii mini are quite significant. This means that in some cases, something that is normally harmless to the Wii could cause a [severe brick](bricks#wi-fi-brick) to the Wii mini. Tread carefully if you are planning to mod one!
+ Be extremely careful when modifying a [Korean Wii](bricks#korean-kiierror-003-brick).
