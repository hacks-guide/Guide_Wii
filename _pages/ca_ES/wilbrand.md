Wilbrand, like LetterBomb, is an exploit for the Wii that is triggered using the Wii Message Board.

Unlike LetterBomb, Wilbrand supports Wii menu versions down to 3.0.
{: .notice--info}

There are two methods listed on this page used to create the proper Wilbrand exploit. Wilbrand Web is recommended for its ease of use.

    + If you don't see the green letter, check if any errors appear in the SD card section of `Data Management`. If there are errors, there may be an issue with the SD card format or the Wii’s SD card reader.
