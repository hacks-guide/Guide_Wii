ModMii is an all-in-one Wii hacking tool for Windows created by XFlak that has various helpful tools for modding. It can accomplish the following:

+ Hacking the console for the first time, or re-hacking it
+ Check for and update outdated softmods
+ Fix upside-down Homebrew Channel problems
+ Run homebrew without making any changes to your Wii's NAND
+ Download homebrew
+ And more!

### ModMii Overview

There are two different ways to use ModMii. There is ModMii Classic, which uses a command line interface, but has all of the features available to the program. ModMii Skin has a graphical user interface, on the other hand, but has less options available to the user. If you're looking to simply mod your Wii for the first time, ModMii Skin should suffice. Otherwise, we reccomend using ModMii Classic where possible. <br> The chart below will help you determine what can be done in either interface.

### Installing ModMii

* A Windows PC (a Virtual Machine will work)

### Using the ModMii Wizard

The ModMii Wizard is tool that can softmod your Wii from start to finish, downloading all necessary files and then generating a guide that you can use to implement the softmod. This tool can also be used to overwrite existing softmods on a previously softmodded Wii.

1. Open ModMii Skin or ModMii Classic and select the ModMii Wizard option at the top of the list.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-1.png)

1. Answer `Yes` to the first question, unless you have a very specific idea of what you would like to do or update to your Wii.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-2.png)

1. Select your current System Menu version, followed by the System Menu Region, following the instructions in the program. If you are still confused, check the bottom option on each screen for an instructional video.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-3.png)

1. Select the exploit you would like to use to mod your Wii. The exploits below are outlined throughout this website, but in most cases we would reccommend using Wilbrand if you have an SD card on hand.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-4.png)

1. If you selected the Wilbrand option in the previous step, enter your Wii's MAC address. If you don't know how to check your Wii's MAC address, enter `Help` in the text box for an instructional video.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-5.png)

1. Select your desired System Menu version from the list.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-6.png)

1. Select whether or not you would like to install any of the listed channels - this is an optional step.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-7.png)

1. Select whether or not you would like to install a custom Wii theme, with the choice of three theme effects. Each effect deals with how much the outline when hovering over a Wii Channel spins.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-8.png)

1. Select whether or not you would like to set up a USB Loader for use with your Wii.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-9.png)

1. If you selected `Yes` in the USB Loader menu, select which USB Loader you would like to use. If you choose an individual one, we reccomend either USB Loader GX or WiiFlow as both are covered on this website, or you may optionally download each option.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-10.png)

1. If you selected `Yes` in the USB Loader menu, select where you would like to save your USB Loader files at.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-11.png)

1. Verify where you would like to save files for your SD Card and/or USB Drive.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-12.png)

1. Confirm your settings are correct, and then press `Finish`. Once you press the button, ModMii will begin to process and download files in the background, and will automatically generate and open a guide for you. From here, you should follow the guide generated by ModMii.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-13.png)

### SysCheck Updater Wizard

The SysCheck Updater Wizard is a tool that utilizes the homebrew app [SysCheck](syscheck) to analyze any modifications on your Wii, especially IOS and cIOS. It accepts a `syscheck.csv` file generated by the app, and then provides any nessecary updates as needed.

1. Open ModMii Classic and enter in `SU` to open the SysCheck Updater Wizard.

    ![](/images/modmii/syscheck-wizard-1.png)

1. Follow the instructions in the window if you don't already have a SysCheck log, and then drag and drop the `syscheck.csv` file from Windows Explorer into the window. This will paste the location of the file, from which you can press Enter.

    ![](/images/modmii/syscheck-wizard-2.png)

1. The program will analyze your SysCheck file, and will provide options for you depending on what it sees. In this example instance, the mods on the Wii were up-to-date, but there were several unnecessary IOSes that could be stubbed. If you want to make these changes to your Wii, simply enter in `Y` and press Enter. From here, you should follow the guide generated by ModMii.

### HackMii Solutions Wizard

The HackMii Solutions Wizard is a tool that fixes problems that may arise from things like Darkcorp/CIOSSPAGHETTI by installing clean IOSes. Examples of problems that may arise because of this are listed below:

+ HackMii Installer not prompting "Press (1) to continue"
+ HackMii Installer saying "no vulnerable IOS found!"
+ Homebrew Channel displaying upside-down

1. Open ModMii Skin or ModMii Classic and select the HackMii Solutions option.

    ![](/images/modmii/hackmii-wizard-1.png)

1. Select your current System Menu version, followed by the System Menu Region, following the instructions in the program. If you are still confused, check the bottom option on each screen for an instructional video.

    ![](/images/modmii/hackmii-wizard-2.png)

1. Select the exploit you would like to use to mod your Wii. The exploits below are outlined throughout this website, but in most cases we would reccommend using Wilbrand if you have an SD card on hand.

    ![](/images/modmii/hackmii-wizard-3.png)

1. If you selected the Wilbrand option in the previous step, enter your Wii's MAC address. If you don't know how to check your Wii's MAC address, enter `Help` in the text box for an instructional video.

    ![](/images/modmii/hackmii-wizard-4.png)

1. Verify where you would like to save files for your SD Card and/or USB Drive.

    ![](/images/modmii/modmii-wizard-12.png)
