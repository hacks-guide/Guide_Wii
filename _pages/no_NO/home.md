### What is homebrew?

**Homebrew** refers to software that was not authorized by the original creator of a piece of hardware - in this case, Nintendo. In order to gain the ability to run homebrew on the Wii, the console must first be modified to run unsigned code.

Get started by [choosing your exploit](get-started)!

+ [Backup](bootmii) and [restore](bootmiirecover) your Wii's NAND (system memory)
+ Enhance the [brick protection](priiloader) of your Wii
+ Download new homebrew apps with the [Open Shop Channel](osc)
+ [Patch game disc contents](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Riivolution) to load game modifications
+ Install [themes](themes) on the Wii Menu and in commonly used homebrew apps
+ Back up your [discs](dump-games) and [other installed titles](dump-wads)
+ Install a [USB loader](wii-loaders) to launch Wii (and other console) backups from an external storage device
+ Back up and restore your [Wii](wii-saves) and [GameCube](gcsaves) save files
+ Restore online functionality to both [WiiConnect24](wiiconnect24) and [Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection](wiimmfi)

### What does the guide install?

This guide aims to do the following, including optional sections:

+ Modify your Wii using one of many exploits, with the end goal of reaching the HackMii installer
+ Install BootMii and the Homebrew Channel
+ Make a backup of critical system files
+ Install Priiloader
+ Install the Open Shop Channel
+ Recommended homebrew to use on your Wii
+ Restore functionality to WiiConnect24 and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection

### What should I know before starting?

+ Homebrew is 100% free, and the process of modifying your Wii is also free. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is likely attempting to [scam you](https://hbc.hackmii.com/scam).
+ This guide works on all system menu versions depending on the exploit, but **it is recommended that you update to 4.3 (the latest firmware)** if possible.
+ **This guide applies to retail/consumer Wiis ONLY!** This means that development units are not covered, nor is the Wii U's vWii.
+ Depending on what you intend to do with your modded Wii, you may have to make some modifications to the system memory that have a risk of bricking (rendering the console inoperable). As long as you follow this guide exactly, you should be fine, but for general brick prevention tips see [this](bricks#brick-prevention) page.
+ The differences between the Wii and Wii mini are quite significant. This means that in some cases, something that is normally harmless to the Wii could cause a [severe brick](bricks#wi-fi-brick) to the Wii mini. Tread carefully if you are planning to mod one!
+ Be extremely careful when modifying a [Korean Wii](bricks#korean-kiierror-003-brick).
