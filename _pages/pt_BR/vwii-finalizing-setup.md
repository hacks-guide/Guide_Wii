## Finalizing Setup

Now that the Homebrew Channel, Priiloader, and cIOS are installed, we are going to finalize the setup.

### Downloading and Installing the Wii Mii Channel

The Mii Channel on the vWii lacks some features, such as connecting to a DS and moving Mii's onto a Wii remote. You have the option of downloading the original Mii Channel WAD from Nintendo and installing it with a [WAD manager](yawmme).

1. Download this script for [Windows](/assets/files/Wii_Mii_Channel_Windows.ps1) or [Mac/Linux](/assets/files/Wii_Mii_Channel_Unix.command)

#### Windows

1. Right click the file and select `Run With PowerShell`
2. Type `R` to run the script
3. When it is done, place the `Mii Channel v6 (Wii).wad` in a folder on your SD card titled `WAD`. You can make one if it does not exist.

#### Mac

1. Double click on the file. It should automatically run.
2. When it is done, place the `Mii Channel v6 (Wii).wad` in a folder on your SD card titled `WAD`. You can make one if it does not exist.

#### Linux

1. Open a terminal in the directory of the file, then type `./Wii_Mii_Channel_Unix.command`
2. When it is done, place the `Mii Channel v6 (Wii).wad` in a folder on your SD card titled `WAD`. You can make one if it does not exist.

#### Installing

1. You can install `Mii Channel v6 (Wii).wad` with [YAWM Modmii Edition](yawmme)

If you get error -1029 while installing, uninstall the wad, then reinstall it. This does not affect your Miis as they are stored in a different place on the NAND.
