<!--
This guide provides the means of regaining WiiConnect24 functionality on your console via RiiConnect24.
Although not at all nessecary, it is a "nice to have" feature that was originally used for online connectivity in certain applications on the console.
These apps include the Forecast/News Channel, Nintendo Channel, Check Mii Out Channel, some Japan-exclusive channels, and more.

[WiiConnect24](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/WiiConnect24) was a service that allowed users with Internet connected Wiis to view the weather & local news, send messages to friends, participate in Mii contest, and more. WiiConnect24 was discontinued on June 27th, 2013.

## RiiConnect24 + WiiLink
[RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz) is a revival service for WiiConnect24 that started in 2015, which allows you to regain its functionality on your console. As of late 2023, the service is now owned by WiiLink, a project that started in 2020 that was previously aiming at the Japanese-exclusive channels.

There is a patcher that ships both of these services together as one - meaning you get all of the international and Japanese-only channels in one package. The guide on how to install these services can be found [on WiiLink's website.](https://www.wiilink24.com/guide/)
