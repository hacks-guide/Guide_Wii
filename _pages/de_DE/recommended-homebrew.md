### Utilities

+ [**YAWM ModMii Edition**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/yawmME) - An extensively supported WAD manager with additional features. Recommended over any other WAD manager due to its extensive anti-brick protection.
+ [SysCheck ModMii Edition](https://oscwii.org/library/app/SysCheckME) - A homebrew application which checks information about your Wii and pastes it back in a readable, sendable format. Think of it like a "System Information" app but for the Wii.

+ [**AnyRegion Changer ME**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/ARCME) - ModMii edition of AnyRegion Changer. While a powerful tool for changing region settings, it can also lead to severe bricks like [Korean Kii/Error 003](bricks#korean-kiierror-003-brick) so **only use this app if you know what you are doing**.
+ [**WiiXplorer-SS**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/wiixplorer-ss) - A modified and updated version of WiiXplorer. A file manager for the Wii, it allows you to view and customize files both on an SD card, a USB device, and the internal Wii memory. For this reason it is a very powerful but also dangerous tool - don't modify files on the system NAND unless you know what you are doing, as it can lead to various types of [bricks](bricks).

+ [CleanRip](https://oscwii.org/library/app/CleanRip) - A tool to backup GameCube and Wii discs. Further information can be found in our [disc dumping guide](dump-games).
