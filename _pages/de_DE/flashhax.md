#### Section II - FlashHax

1. Open the site from the bookmark
1. Wait a while
    + It may take some time as it is downloading the installer over the Internet.

1. It'll then proceed to download and load the HackMii Installer.
    + This may take multiple tries.
    + If the HackMii Installer doesn't load and it instead freezes (you can't move your cursor), please restart your Wii and repeat step 3 until it works. It might take multiple tries, be persistent!

If you still can't get it to load, try deleting your cookies or save data for the Internet Channel.

If after several tries Flashhax still does not work, you should try a [different exploit](get-started) instead.
