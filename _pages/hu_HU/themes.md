This guide is intended to be the last you will ever need when it comes to theming on the Wii, not only providing instructions for the Wii Menu through csm-installer, but also with themes on WiiFlow Lite, USB Loader GX, and The Homebrew Channel. Additionally, forwarders are covered.

### Wii Menu témázás

DO NOT CONTINUE WITH THIS GUIDE UNLESS YOU HAVE ADEQUATE BRICK PROTECTION, SPECIFICALLY [BOOTMII](bootmii) (Wii only) AND [PRIILOADER](priiloader)!
{: .notice--danger}

This tutorial does not work on the Wii mini. Do not attempt this tutorial on the Wii mini or it will cause a [brick](bricks#theme-brick).
{: .notice--warning}

csm-installer has built in safety features to prevent from installing bad or corrupt Wii Menu themes, so please opt to use it instead of other theme installation homebrew.
{: .notice--warning}

Do not use any other version of ThemeMii than the one linked here, as ThemeMii Mod allows you to make a theme for Wii Menu version 4.3, other versions may not.
{: .notice--warning}

Only install themes on your Wii that have been formatted specifically for its version and current region. Installing themes from the wrong version or region on your Wii will cause a [brick](bricks#theme-brick). This tutorial will tell you how to create a .csm file that is safe to install.
{: .notice--danger}

Before proceeding, it helps to know the difference between .MYM and .CSM as file formats when used in Wii Menu theming. While the MYM is made by the theme creator which can then be shared around, the CSM is the result from building a MYM into a system menu. In other words, MYM mainly just holds assets - the actual system menu itself that needs to be installed comes seperate.

### WiiFlow Lite Theming

Unfortunately, because of the codebase difference between the original WiiFlow and the newer WiiFlow Lite, themes are sparse - in fact, only one theme could be found that confidently works on the newer version. The instructions for installing that theme are below.

#### Útmutató

1. Have the storage device that holds WiiFlow Lite connected to your PC.
2. Download the Rhapsodii Shima archive, either version of the theme works and can be installed side-by-side with no issues.
3. Extract and copy the `wiiflow` folder to the root of your storage device, merge all folders and overwrite all files when requested.
4. Follow the theme setup and theme configuration instructions in `installation.txt`. Enjoy the theme!

### App Forwarder-ek

App forwarders can add a bit of extra flair to your Wii Menu - but be careful with them as bad forwarders can cause a [banner brick](bricks#banner-brick). Generally, you can find forwarders on places like [GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-forwarder-repository.588781/) for popular apps such as emulators. Since forwarders come in a .WAD format, the process of installing them is as simple as normal usage with [YAWM ModMii Edition](yawmme).
