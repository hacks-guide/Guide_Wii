# Key Information

This page includes important disclaimers and information regarding the modding process that you should know before starting.

## Bricks and Common Risks

When following the guide or using specific kinds of homebrew, there is a risk that you may brick your console - or put it into a state where it is partially or fully unusable. To prevent this, please follow the guide **exactly as written** and follow precautions when stated. Common risks for bricking are slated as below:

+ Following old modding tutorials or video guides unless explicitly recommended due to outdated or incorrect information
+ Restoring NAND backups from other consoles
+ Installing cIOS packs like DARKCORP
+ Installing updates intended for another region, or region changing your console
+ Modifying system files

Please consult the [bricks guide](bricks) for more information.

## Console Compatibility

This guide works with all off-the-shelf retail Wiis, as well as the Wii U vWii.
It does **NOT** work with development Wiis, including models:

+ RVT-001 (NDEV)
+ RVT-002 (green frontplate)
+ RVT-005 (red frontplate)

Important notes relating to specific Wiis are below.

:::: details What if I own a Korean Wii?

A Korean Wii is fully supported, and can also be region changed.
Exercise caution when modifying region data and follow guides carefully to avoid a brick.

:::: details What if I own a Wii U (vWii)?

vWii (Wii mode on Wii U) is fully supported but it is recommended to setup an Aroma environment.
Missing Wii features can be restored. Almost all existing homebrew is currently supported.
Make sure to install the vWii version of homebrew and IOS whenever available to avoid bricking.

Wii Mini is supported and has compatibility with the most existing homebrew.
A LAN adapter and USB hub are recommended.
Be especially cautious with IOS to avoid bricking.

## Storage Compatibility

For SD cards, you will want a minimum of 128MB to run an exploit. On average, however, you will want a card that is sized 2GB or more. Format as FAT32.

For USB devices, you will want to use a USB hard drive or solid state drive formatted as either FAT32 or NTFS. We do not recommend using flash drives as they are prone to not working as intended with a Wii.

Please consult [the storage FAQ](faq#storage-device-faq) for more information.

## Network Compatibility

The Wii is an aging console, and as such, may have difficulties connecting to modern wireless networks.

Its network hardware is based on 802.11g (retroactively named WiFi 3), which operates on the 2.4 GHz band. It also supports a maximum of WPA2-PSK (AES) personal network encryption. You must make sure your network supports these standards if you would like to use WiFi with your Wii.

Please consult [the network FAQ](faq#networking-faq) for more information.
