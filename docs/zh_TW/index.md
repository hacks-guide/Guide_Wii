## What is "homebrew"?

**Homebrew** refers to software that was not authorized by the original creator of a piece of hardware - in this case, Nintendo. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)"><strong x-id="1">Homebrew</strong></a> refers to software not authorized by Nintendo. This can include games, utilities, emulators and much more! In order to gain the ability to run homebrew on the Wii, the console must first be modified to run unsigned code.

Here's a list of things you can do using homebrew. While this list is by no means totally comprehensive, you should have a good idea of what is possible, and the guide will help you easily get started.

- [Backup](bootmii) and [restore](bootmiirecover) your Wii's NAND (system memory)
- Enhance the [brick protection](priiloader) of your Wii
- Download new homebrew apps with the [Open Shop Channel](osc)
- [Patch game disc contents](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Riivolution) to load game modifications
- Install [themes](themes) on the Wii Menu and in commonly used homebrew apps
- Back up your [discs](dump-games) and [other installed titles](dump-wads)
- Watch [DVDs](recommended-homebrew#entertainment) and play external media files on your Wii
- Install a [USB loader](wii-loaders) to launch Wii (and other console) backups from an external storage device
- Restore online functionality to both [WiiConnect24](wiiconnect24) and [Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection](wiimmfi)

## What does the guide install?

This guide aims to do the following, including optional sections:

- Modify your Wii using one of many exploits, with the end goal of reaching the HackMii installer
- Install BootMii and the Homebrew Channel
- Make a backup of critical system files
- Install Priiloader
- Install the Open Shop Channel
- Recommended homebrew to use on your Wii
- Restore functionality to WiiConnect24 and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection

## What should I know before starting?

- Running homebrew on your Nintendo Wii can be done for free by exploiting bugs in Wii's software. The modifications installed by following this guide will give you easy and persistent access to Wii homebrew. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is likely attempting to <a href="https://hbc.hackmii.com/scam">scam you</a>. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is likely attempting to [scam you](https://hbc.hackmii.com/scam).
- This guide works on all system menu versions depending on the exploit, but **it is recommended that you update to 4.3 (the latest firmware)** if possible.
- **This guide applies to retail/consumer Wiis ONLY!** This means that development units are not covered.
- Depending on what you intend to do with your modded Wii, you may have to make some modifications to the system memory that have a risk of bricking (rendering the console inoperable). As long as you follow this guide exactly, you should be fine, but for general brick prevention tips see [this](bricks#brick-prevention) page.
- The differences between the Wii and Wii mini are quite significant. This means that in some cases, something that is normally harmless to the Wii could cause a [severe brick](bricks#wi-fi-brick) to the Wii mini. Tread carefully if you are planning to mod one!
- Be extremely careful when modifying a [Korean Wii](bricks#korean-kiierror-003-brick).
