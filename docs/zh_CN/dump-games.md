## Dumping a Wii Disc

::: info

As of v2.1.2 of CleanRip, there is an option to auto-detect whether or not the disc you have is dual layer. If you are on an earlier version, or just want to verify that the correct option is being selected, you can check [this list](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Dual_Layer_Disc_games) to see if your game is a dual layer disc.

:::

::: warning

If you get an unrecovered read error, ensure that the disc you are attempting to dump is clean and can be properly read by the console. Even though you may be able to play the game disc normally, you may still get this error. If the error persists, try to dump another disc and see if the same error happens.
