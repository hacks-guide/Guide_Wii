## 什么是“自制（homebrew）”？

**Homebrew** refers to software that was not authorized by the original creator of a piece of hardware - in this case, Nintendo. In order to gain the ability to run homebrew on the Wii, the console must first be modified to run unsigned code.

Here are some common examples of what homebrew can do for your Wii:

- [Backup](bootmii) and [restore](bootmiirecover) your Wii's NAND (system memory)
- Enhance the [brick protection](priiloader) of your Wii
- Download new homebrew apps with the [Open Shop Channel](osc)
- [Patch game disc contents](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Riivolution) to load game modifications
- Install [themes](themes) on the Wii Menu and in commonly used homebrew apps
- Back up your [discs](dump-games) and [other installed titles](dump-wads)
- Watch [DVDs](recommended-homebrew#entertainment) and play external media files on your Wii
- Install a [USB loader](wii-loaders) to launch Wii (and other console) backups from an external storage device
- Restore online functionality to both [WiiConnect24](wiiconnect24) and [Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection](wiimmfi)

## What does the guide install?

This guide aims to do the following, including optional sections:

- 通过利用 Wii 的漏洞，可以免费在任天堂 Wii 中运行自制软件。 通过本指南进行破解，将使您能够轻松而持久地访问 Wii 自制软件。

- This guide works on all system menu versions depending on the exploit, but **it is recommended that you update to 4.3 (the latest firmware)** if possible.
- **This guide applies to retail/consumer Wiis ONLY!** This means that development units are not covered.
- Depending on what you intend to do with your modded Wii, you may have to make some modifications to the system memory that have a risk of bricking (rendering the console inoperable). As long as you follow this guide exactly, you should be fine, but for general brick prevention tips see <a href="bricks#brick-prevention">this</a> page. As long as you follow this guide exactly, you should be fine, but for general brick prevention tips see [this](bricks#brick-prevention) page.
- The differences between the Wii and Wii mini are quite significant. This means that in some cases, something that is normally harmless to the Wii could cause a [severe brick](bricks#wi-fi-brick) to the Wii mini. Tread carefully if you are planning to mod one!
- Be extremely careful when modifying a [Korean Wii](bricks#koreankii-error-003-brick).
