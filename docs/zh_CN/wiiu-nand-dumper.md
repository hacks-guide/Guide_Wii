# vWii Modding Guide

This page will guide you through the process of modding your vWii without modding the Wii U side. Wii U custom firmware will be used for this guide, however, nothing will actually be installed onto the Wii U side itself. You can also visit the [legacy exploits](legacy-exploits) page for more exploits that work on the vWii.

::: info

If your Wii U side is already modded, proceed to [Installing the Homebrew Channel](vwii-homebrew-channel)

::: info

Your SD Card will need to be formatted as FAT32. If your SD Card is not formatted to FAT32, follow [this guide](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card) to format it. **Do not** label the SD Card as `wiiu` or it will cause issues with homebrew.

### Section II - Launching the Exploit

::: info

Make sure your Wii U has internet access for this step.

:::

1. Take the SD Card out of your computer and plug it into your Wii U console.
2. Launch the Internet Browser and navigate to the website `wiiuexploit.xyz`.
3. Click on `Run Exploit!` and hold the B button until you see a screen that says `Please choose your payload:`, this will be necessary for the next steps.
 - If your Wii U gets stuck on a white or otherwise frozen screen, wait a few seconds. If nothing happens, reboot the console, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.
 - If you see the EnvironmentLoader, you did not hold down B long enough. Try again.

### Section III - NAND Backup

In case anything goes wrong in the later process and your vWii ends up bricked, restoring a previously made NAND backup can fix it.

1. Use the Wii U GamePad's D-Pad to enter the following configuration:
 - Dump SLC: **optional**
 - Dump SLCCMPT: **yes**
 - Dump MLC: **optional**
 - Dump OTP: **yes**
 - Dump SEEPROM: **optional**
2. Press the A button to start the dumping process.
3. When the process completed, power off your Wii U, take your SD Card out of the Wii U and plug it into your PC.
4. To make sure you don't lose the files, copy the `slccmpt.bin` and `otp.bin` files (and if you chose to go with a full backup, `seeprom.bin`, `slc.bin`, and `every mlc.bin.part` file) to your computer.
5. Delete the files from your SD Card to free up space.
6. Take the SD Card out of your computer and plug it into your Wii U console.
