## What is "homebrew"?

**Homebrew** refers to software that was not authorized to run on a video game console by its manufacturer. To gain the ability to run homebrew on the Wii, the console must first be modified to run unsigned code.

Common examples of homebrew usage on the Wii include:

- [Backing up](bootmii) and [restoring](bootmiirecover) your Wii's NAND (system memory)
- [Patching game discs](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Riivolution) to load game modifications
- Installing [themes](themes) on the Wii Menu and in commonly used homebrew apps
- Backing up your [discs](dump-games) and [other installed titles](dump-wads)
- Installing a [USB loader](wii-loaders) to launch Wii (and other console) backups from an external storage device
- Restoring online functionality to both [WiiConnect24](wiiconnect24) and [Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection](nintendowfc)
- and more!
