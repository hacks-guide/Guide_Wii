# cIOS

:::details Technical Details (optional)

cIOS (Custom IOS) are IOS that are patched to allow custom functionality. While [cIOS](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Custom_IOS) has largely been supplanted by AHBPROT, which gives complete hardware access, it still has useful applications. For example, this enables the functionality of USB loaders like USB Loader GX and WiiFlow, alongside other pieces of homebrew like SaveGame Manager GX. You can skip this process if you want, but generally it extends your Wii with little to no downsides.

## Instructions

### Section I - Downloading

::: info

If you are on macOS or Linux, you may download & run [this script](/assets/files/d2x_offline_ios.zip), and it will download the WAD files for you.

:::

::: info

If you are able to connect your Wii to the internet, you may skip to [Section II](cios#section-ii---installing)

:::

1. Power off your console.
2. SD card veya USB cihazınızı bilgisayarınıza takın.
3. On your computer, download [NUS Downloader](https://github.com/WiiDatabase/nusdownloader/releases/latest/download/NUSD-Mod-NUS-Fix.zip).
4. Copy all files from the NUS Downloader `.zip` to a folder on your computer.
5. Run `NUS Downloader.exe`.
6. Navigate to `Database` > `IOS` > `IOS38`, then select `v4123`.
   - Ensure that "Pack WAD" is checked.
   - _Don't_ check "Patch IOS". That is the cIOS Installer's job.
7. Click `Start NUS Download!`.
8. Repeat the above steps for `IOS56 v5661`, `IOS57 v5918` and `IOS58 v6175`.
9. When the process is complete, there will be a folder named `titles` in the same folder as the NUS Downloader.
10. Open the `titles` folder and navigate through them until you locate the four WAD files you downloaded.
11. You can now use homebrew such as <a href="usbloadergx">USB Loader GX</a> and <a href="wiiflow">WiiFlow</a>.
    - This must be the same device containing the d2x cIOS Installer.

::: info

The WAD files should be on your SD card like this:
