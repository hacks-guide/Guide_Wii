+ [Patching game discs](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Riivolution) to load game modifications
+ Installing [themes](themes) on the Wii Menu and in commonly used homebrew apps
+ Backing up your [discs](dump-games) and [other installed titles](dump-wads)
+ Installing a [USB loader](wii-loaders) to launch Wii (and other console) backups from an external storage device
+ Restoring online functionality to both [WiiConnect24](wiiconnect24) and [Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection](nintendowfc)
