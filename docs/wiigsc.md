# Creating Wii Game Shortcuts

This guide provides instructions on how to create Wii game shortcuts for game backups that you have on external storage devices, using a piece of software called WiiGSC (Wii Game Shortcut Creator). By creating game shortcuts, you can launch a game backup directly from the Wii Menu as if you had inserted the game as a regular disc.

::: warning

Installing [Priiloader](priiloader) and [BootMii](bootmii) are advised due to brick risk in this guide, and should keep you safe along with following the guide correctly. Do NOT continue the guide unless you have installed Priiloader or BootMii!

:::

::: warning

Do NOT make a shortcut for the games "Mario Party 9" or "A Boy and His Blob". It will brick your Wii.

::: warning

Your browser or antivirus software may flag WiiGSC as malware - this is a false positive. WiiGSC does NOT contain any malware.

:::

::: info

The Wii Menu is limited to 48 channels, not including existing system channels.

## Requirements

## Instructions

### Section I - Creating a Channel

1. Extract the WiiGSC `.zip`, find `WiiGSC.exe`, and launch it. The first launch will prompt you about common key creation and provide a disclaimer - simply click through these windows.

1. With WiiGSC open, select `Open WBFS Drive` and select the drive letter for the device containing your WBFS files. Alternatively, you may select an individual ISO/WBFS file.

::: info

If you get an error saying "The system files are corrupted", don't panic as long as you installed Priiloader. Turn off your Wii, then [boot into Priiloader](priiloader#section-iii---entering-priiloader) using one of the available methods for your console. Enter the Homebrew Channel and launch your WAD manager to uninstall the WAD. If priiloader was not installed, proceed to [BlueBomb](bluebomb).
