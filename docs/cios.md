:::: tab cIOS for Wii/Family Edition

::: details Technical Details (optional)

cIOS (Custom IOS) are IOS that are patched to allow custom functionality. While [cIOS](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Custom_IOS) has largely been supplanted by AHBPROT, which gives complete hardware access, it still has useful applications. For example, this enables the functionality of USB loaders like USB Loader GX and WiiFlow, alongside other pieces of homebrew like SaveGame Manager GX. You can skip this process if you want, but generally it extends your Wii with little to no downsides.

:::

::: warning

Do not attempt to install a vWii/Wii mini IOS or System Menu on the Wii. Doing so will likely [brick](bricks#ios-brick) your console.

:::

## Requirements

* A Wii with the Homebrew Channel installed
* An SD card or USB drive
* The [d2x cIOS Installer](/assets/files/d2x-cios-installer.zip)

::: warning

Ensure that if you are using an SD card, the lock switch is in the unlocked position, otherwise you will not be able to select the correct options in the installer.

:::

## Instructions

### Section I - Downloading

::: info

If you are on macOS or Linux, you may download & run [this script](/assets/files/d2x_offline_ios.zip), and it will download the WAD files for you.

:::

::: info

If you are able to connect your Wii to the internet, you may skip to [Section II](cios#section-ii---installing)

:::

1. Power off your console.
1. Insert your SD card or USB drive into your computer.

1. Run `NUS Downloader.exe`.
1. Navigate to `Database` > `IOS` > `IOS38`, then select `v4123`.
    + Ensure that "Pack WAD" is checked.
    + *Don't* check "Patch IOS". That is the cIOS Installer's job.
1. Click `Start NUS Download!`.
1. Repeat the above steps for `IOS56 v5661`, `IOS57 v5918` and `IOS58 v6175`.
1. When the process is complete, there will be a folder named `titles` in the same folder as the NUS Downloader.
1. Open the `titles` folder and navigate through them until you locate the four WAD files you downloaded.
1. Place each WAD file on the root of your SD card or USB drive.
    + This must be the same device containing the d2x cIOS Installer.

This d2x cIOS installer was originally developed for the Wii U's vWii by DaveBaol and custom cIOS was created by Leseratte for the Wii mini. The original download page can be found [here](https://wii.leseratte10.de/d2xl-cIOS/). Leseratte's GitHub page can be found [here](https://github.com/Leseratte10/d2xl-cios). Please note that this cIOS is still experimental, though no problem with functionality has been reported.

### Enabling Ethernet

If you wish to use Wiimmfi with Ethernet on a Wii mini, you have to run the [Ethernet Enabler Homebrew](/assets/files/Wii_Mini_Ethernet_Enable.zip) app made by Fullmetal5. To run it, just unzip it in the `apps` folder of your USB drive and run it from the Homebrew Channel.

::: info

The Wii and Wii mini consoles are only known to work with Ethernet adapters using the AX88772 chip. Please check that the product is compatible before you buy. This one from UGREEN is known to be compatible: [Amazon Europe](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00MYT481C), [Amazon US](https://a.co/d/3OcSJDS)
