## Required Reading

You can now use the Homebrew Channel to launch homebrew apps.

Here's a tip - when installing homebrew applications on your SD Card or USB drive, your folder structure should look like this:

```
💾 SD Card or USB Drive
| ╸📁 apps
	| ╸📁 AppName1
		| ╸📄 boot.dol
		| ╸📄 meta.xml
		| ╸📄 icon.png
	| ╸📁 AppName2
		| ╸📄 boot.dol
		| ╸📄 meta.xml
		| ╸📄 icon.png
```

`AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. Do not nest multiple `apps` folders inside the `apps` folder itself.

::: tip

[Continue to making a NAND Backup using BootMii](bootmii)<br>
Making a NAND backup at this point is highly recommended, as they can be used to recover from bricks.

:::

::: tip

Tip: You can tell if a Wii has BootMii installed as boot2 if your disc drive flashes very briefly, only after the immediate flash that happens when you press the POWER Button.
