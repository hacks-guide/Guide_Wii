## Homebrew Channel and BootMii Installation for Wii

This guide instructs you on how to install the Homebrew Channel and BootMii. The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications, and BootMii allows you to create and restore backups of your Wii's NAND storage.

::: warning

If you do not have an SD card, you cannot install nor use BootMii, and therefore will not be able to utilize any of the mentioned benefits.

You can always [install it later](hackmii).

:::

:::details Disclaimer for BootMii with boot2

BootMii can be installed in two ways: via IOS, or directly to a part of the Wii bootloader called boot2. If possible, it is urged to install as boot2 as it provides extended brick protection and can be loaded prior to most major brick errors, but Wiis with a vulnerable boot1 that allows this installation are considerably rarer; all having been manufactured before 2009.

In most cases, you will not be able to install BootMii under boot2. Installing BootMii as IOS will usually be good enough, as long as you also install [Priiloader](priiloader). If you DO have the option to install as boot2, you should install both boot2 and IOS as instructed below so that you can launch BootMii in ways other than starting the console.

Please note that if you install Bootmii as boot2, your disc drive will flash very briefly after the immediate flash that happens when you press the POWER Button.

:::

## Instructions

1. Your console should be powered on and showing the HackMii Installer from the previous part of the guide.

### Required Reading

You can now use the Homebrew Channel to launch homebrew apps.

Here's a tip - when installing homebrew applications on your SD Card or USB drive, your folder structure should look like this:

```shell
💾 SD Card or USB Drive
| ╸📁 apps
    | ╸📁 AppName1
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
    | ╸📁 AppName2
        | ╸📄 boot.dol
        | ╸📄 meta.xml
        | ╸📄 icon.png
```

`AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. Do not nest multiple `apps` folders inside the `apps` folder itself.

::: tip

[Continue to making a NAND Backup using BootMii](bootmii)

Making a NAND backup at this point is highly recommended, as they can be used to recover from bricks.
