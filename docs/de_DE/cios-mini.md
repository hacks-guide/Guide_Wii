### Enabling Ethernet

If you wish to use Wiimmfi with Ethernet on a Wii mini, you have to run the [Ethernet Enabler Homebrew](/assets/files/Wii_Mini_Ethernet_Enable.zip) app made by Fullmetal5. To run it, just unzip it in the `apps` folder of your USB drive and run it from the Homebrew Channel.

::: info

The Wii and Wii mini consoles are only known to work with Ethernet adapters using the AX88772 chip. Please check that the product is compatible before you buy. This one from UGREEN is known to be compatible: [Amazon Europe](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00MYT481C), [Amazon US](https://a.co/d/3OcSJDS)
