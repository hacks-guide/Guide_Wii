# Legacy Exploits

This page lists different exploits that were/can still be used on the Wii and vWii to hack the console, but are no longer recommended.

::: info

**Note for vWii:** if one of these exploits is planned to be used, it is recommended to [update the Homebrew Channel](https://github.com/FIX94/hbc/releases/tag/1.1.4-1) afterwards using a [WAD manager](yawmme) because it provides some fixes specific to the vWii.  Additionally, Bootmii is not supported on the vWii, so the NAND would either have to be dumped via the [WiiU NAND Dumper](wiiu-nand-dumper), or [Dump Mii NAND](https://oscwii.org/library/app/DmpMiNND) on the vWii.
