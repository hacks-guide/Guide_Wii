- An SD card formatted as FAT32 that is 32GB or less
- A Wii on System Menu version 4.3
- A Windows/MacOS/Linux computer with an Internet connection

## Instructions

1. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.

2. Go to `Wii Settings`.

3. Take note in the top right corner of the letter next to the system version.

    - This letter corresponds to your system menu region, which you will need to know for the corresponding steps.
    - Also, ensure that you are on System Menu version 4.3.

10. Insert your SD card into your computer.

11. Copy the `private` folder and the `boot.elf` file from the LetterBomb `.zip` to the root of your SD card.

12. Take out your SD card and insert it in your Wii.
    - The SD card must be inserted in the SD card slot located in the front of the Wii. Using a USB to SD adapter plugged into the Wii's USB port will not work.

13. On your Wii, return to the Wii Menu and then open the Wii Message Board.

14. Launch the Wii Message Board.

15. Open the red letter with a bomb.
    - Ensure the date on your Wii is correct, otherwise you might be unable to find the letter.
    - In some cases, you may need to check the messages for tommorow or yesterday for the letter to show up.
    - If you don't see the red letter, check if any errors appear in the SD card section of `Data Management`. If any do, there may be an issue with the SD card format or the Wiiâ€™s SD card reader.
    - If your Wii freezes after clicking on the letter, you most likely chose the wrong system menu region for LetterBomb. Go back to Step 2 and verify that you chose the right region.
    - If all is correct and there is freezing, keep on trying until it works.

16. If the exploit was successful, your device will have loaded the HackMii Installer.
