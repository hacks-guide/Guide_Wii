## BlueBomb Micro

{% capture technical_info %}
<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
BlueBomb Micro is a port of Fullmetal5's BlueBomb exploit for the Rasperry Pi Pico W or ESP32, thus bypassing the need for a Linux system. It takes advantage of a flaw in the Wii and Wii mini's Bluetooth libraries. This port was made possible by [GaryOderNichts](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts)

This exploit also enables recovery from certain bricks, such as banner bricks and (some) theme bricks.

{: .notice--info}

It is **strongly** advised against using **any** video guide for hacking your Wii mini console, as there is an extremely large chance of **bricking** it.
{: .notice--warning}

If you need help with anything regarding this tutorial, please join [the Wii mini Hacking Discord server](https://discord.gg/6ryxnkS) (recommended)
{: .notice--info}

If you are using the original revision of the Wii, you should probably find [another exploit to use](get-started) as there are much easier ways to get to the HackMii installer. Exceptions however, exist in circumstances like brick recovery.
{: .notice--info}

Make sure that the console is close to the computer running the exploit, ideally it should be less than 3 feet.

### Requirements
* A Rasperry Pi Pico W or an ESP32 with BR/EDR (Classic) support.
* A USB flash drive formatted as FAT32.
* [The HackMii Installer](https://bootmii.org/download/)

A normal Rasperry Pi Pico will not work. It MUST to be the wireless model. Additionally, an ESP32 with a BLE only controller will not work.
{: .notice--info}

### Instructions

1. Copy `boot.elf` from the hackmii_installer_v1.2 `.zip` to the root of your flash drive.
    + (If attempting to fix a brick, you should also copy the homebrew app you wish to use to /apps/)
    + (Even for a Wii mini, bootmini.elf will **not** work, its purpose is entirely different and unrelated. Use boot.elf in all cases).
1. Reinsert your flash drive into your console.
    + For a Wii mini, the USB port is on the back.
    + For a normal Wii, use the bottom port (or the right port if it's upright).
1. Power on your console.
1. Go to `Wii Settings`.
1. Take note in the top right corner of the letter next to the system version.
    + This letter corresponds to your system menu region, which you will need to know for the corresponding steps.

1. Power off your console.

#### Rasperry Pi Pico W

1. Download [The latest Pre-Compiled Binaries](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/bluebomb_micro/releases) from the releases page, and extract it to your PC.
1. Plug in your Pico W to your PC while holding down the `BOOTSEL` button. Your Pico should now show up as a drive on your PC.
1. Unzip the downloaded file and copy the file which matches your Wii or Wii mini to the drive. For example, if you have a European Wii running version 4.3, you would copy bluebomb_WII_SM4_3E.uf2, or if you have a European Wii Mini, you would copy bluebomb_MINI_SM_PAL.uf2, etc...
1. The drive should disconnect and your Pico is ready. You may unplug the device from your PC.

#### ESP32

1. Set up the latest [ESP IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html).
1. Build the binary [from source](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/bluebomb_micro/tree/main/ports/esp32#building-from-source).
1. [Flash the binary](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/bluebomb_micro/tree/main/ports/esp32#flashing) to your ESP32.
1. Your device is now ready. You may unplug the device from your PC.

### Performing the Exploit

1. Plug your flashed device back into your PC.
1. Power on your console.
    + **Do not** connect any Wii Remotes.
1. Press the Sync button repeatedly until the bluebomb screen shows up.
    + This could take numerous attempts.
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have loaded the HackMii Installer.

<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
BlueBomb is an exploit that takes advantage of a flaw in the Wii and Wii mini's Bluetooth libraries. Although it is the only exploit that works for the Wii mini, BlueBomb can run on the original Wii as well.

### str2hax Method

* A Linux machine
    * A Virtual Machine may work, but it is not recommended due to its complexity in getting Bluetooth passthrough working. If possible, please use a LiveUSB as described below.
    * If you have a Raspberry Pi, you can use that instead as it most likely has Linux installed already.
    * Windows Subsystem for Linux or a Chromebook running Linux mode will *not work* as they don't have direct access to the Bluetooth adapter or USB ports.
    * If you do not have Linux, [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) is the most user-friendly option and can be ran on computers running Windows or Mac.
        * 32-bit devices will require [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/).
        * For 64-bit devices it is recommended to use the LTS edition due to its stability, but the latest release works as well.
    * You can [flash a Linux Live environment to a USB flash drive](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) instead of installing it to your computer.
* A Bluetooth adapter.
    * An internal Bluetooth adapter will work.
    * If you do not have one, make sure to get one compatible with Linux.
* A USB flash drive formatted as FAT32.
    * This cannot be the same flash drive used for your Linux Machine.
* [HackMii Installer v1.2](https://bootmii.org/download/)

### Instructions

1. Copy `boot.elf` from the hackmii_installer_v1.2 `.zip` to the root of your flash drive.
    + (If attempting to fix a brick, you should also copy the homebrew app you wish to use to /apps/)
    + (Even for a Wii mini, bootmini.elf will **not** work, its purpose is entirely different and unrelated. Use boot.elf in all cases).
1. Reinsert your flash drive into your console.
    + For a Wii mini, the USB port is on the back.
    + For a normal Wii, use the bottom port (or the right port if it's upright).
1. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.
1. Extract the Wilbrand zip to a folder on your PC, preferably on your desktop.
1. Take note in the top right corner of the letter next to the system version.
    + This letter corresponds to your system menu region, which you will need to know for the corresponding steps.

    ![](/images/wii/SystemMenuVersion.png)

1. Download the Priiloader installer and LoadPriiloader apps.
1. Start your Linux distro, and ensure you are connected to the internet.
1. Open the Terminal
1. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    wget https://wii.hacks.guide/assets/files/bluebomb-helper.sh
    chmod +x bluebomb-helper.sh
    ./bluebomb-helper.sh
    ```

1. The helper will then download the required files, and ask for information about your console.
    + If you have selected a Wii mini you will be asked to provide your region. This can be determined by the last letter of the Wii Menu version (`U` for **USA** and `E` for **PAL** models).
    + If you have selected a Wii you will be asked to provide your Wii Menu Version (What you determined in step 4)
1. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.
    + **Do not** connect any Wii Remotes.
1. Press the Sync button repeatedly until the terminal shows `got connection handle`.
    + This could take numerous attempts.
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have loaded the HackMii Installer.
    + If you are not planning to use it later, you can now shut down your Linux distro.
