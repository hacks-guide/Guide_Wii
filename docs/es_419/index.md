## What is "homebrew"?

**Homebrew** refers to software that was not authorized by the original creator of a piece of hardware - in this case, Nintendo. This can include games, utilities, emulators and much more!

Here's a list of things you can do using homebrew.

- [Backup](bootmii) and [restore](bootmiirecover) your Wii's NAND (system memory)
- Enhance the [brick protection](priiloader) of your Wii
- Download new homebrew apps with the [Open Shop Channel](osc)
- [Patch game disc contents](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Riivolution) to load game modifications
- Install [themes](themes) on the Wii Menu and in commonly used homebrew apps
- Back up your [discs](dump-games) and [other installed titles](dump-wads)
- Watch [DVDs](recommended-homebrew#entertainment) and play external media files on your Wii
- Install a [USB loader](wii-loaders) to launch Wii (and other console) backups from an external storage device
- Restore online functionality to both [WiiConnect24](wiiconnect24) and [Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection](wiimmfi)

## What does the guide install?

This guide aims to do the following, including optional sections:

- Modify your Wii using one of many exploits, with the end goal of reaching the HackMii installer
- Install BootMii and the Homebrew Channel
- Make a backup of critical system files
- Install Priiloader
- Install the Open Shop Channel
- Recommended homebrew to use on your Wii
- Turn your Wii into a media player with <a href="https://oscwii.org/library/app/wiimc-ss">WiiMC</a>.

## What should I know before starting?

- Running homebrew on your Nintendo Wii can be done for free by exploiting bugs in Wii's software. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is likely attempting to [scam you](https://hbc.hackmii.com/scam).
- This guide works on all system menu versions depending on the exploit, but **it is recommended that you update to 4.3 (the latest firmware)** if possible.
- **This guide applies to retail/consumer Wiis ONLY!** This means that development units are not covered.
- Depending on what you intend to do with your modded Wii, you may have to make some modifications to the system memory that have a risk of bricking (rendering the console inoperable). As long as you follow this guide exactly, you should be fine, but for general brick prevention tips see [this](bricks#brick-prevention) page.
- The differences between the Wii and Wii mini are quite significant. This means that in some cases, something that is normally harmless to the Wii could cause a [severe brick](bricks#wi-fi-brick) to the Wii mini. Tread carefully if you are planning to mod one!
- Be extremely careful when modifying a [Korean Wii](bricks#korean-kiierror-003-brick).
