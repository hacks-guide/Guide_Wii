# Instalación del Canal Homebrew y BootMii

:::details Technical Details (optional)

BootMii can be installed in two ways: directly to a part of the Wii bootloader called boot2, and via an IOS. Install BootMii as IOS, even if you already installed BootMii as boot2 in the previous step. In most cases, installing BootMii as IOS should be fine, as long as you also install [Priiloader](priiloader).

::: warning

If you do not have an SD card, you cannot install nor use BootMii, and therefore will not be able to utilize any of the mentioned benefits.
You can always [install it later](hackmii).

## Required Reading

When at the HackMii installer, you are able to install the Homebrew Channel and BootMii.

Here's a tip - when installing homebrew applications on your SD Card or USB drive, your folder structure should look like this:

```
💾 SD Card or USB Drive
| ╸📁 apps
	| ╸📁 AppName1
		| ╸📄 boot.dol
		| ╸📄 meta.xml
		| ╸📄 icon.png
	| ╸📁 AppName2
		| ╸📄 boot.dol
		| ╸📄 meta.xml
		| ╸📄 icon.png
```

`AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. Do not nest multiple `apps` folders inside the `apps` folder itself.

::: tip

[Continue to making a NAND Backup using BootMii](bootmii)

Making a NAND backup at this point is highly recommended, as they can be used to recover from bricks.

:::

::: tip

Tip: You can tell if a Wii has BootMii installed as boot2 if your disc drive flashes very briefly, only after the immediate flash that happens when you press the POWER Button.
