# Managing GameCube Backups

This guide provides instructions on how to manage your GameCube backups, using GameCube Backup Manager. It functions similar to [Wii Backup Manager](wii-backups#using-wii-backup-manager).

## Requisitos

- A Windows PC
- Una tarjeta SD o unidad USB
- [GameCube Backup Manager](https://github.com/AxionDrak/GameCube-Backup-Manager/releases)

::: info

To play multiple games, it is recommended to use an external hard drive for your Wii. Any external hard drive found on most modern marketplaces should work with your Wii.

:::

::: info

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. Do not format it as other types such as NTFS, exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter being an outdated filesystem for storing Wii games.

::: info

Selecting `Install Game (Scrub)` will remove unnecessary data from the game, reducing the game's file size. For some games this can be a major reduction, for example with Animal Crossing - going from 1.3GB to around 26MB.
