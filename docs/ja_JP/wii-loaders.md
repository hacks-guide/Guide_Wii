Below is a single WBFS example, and a split WBFS example. A WBFS needs to be split if it is over 4 GB and your storage device is formatted as FAT32. Software such as [Wii Backup Manager](wii-backups#using-wii-backup-manager) or [Wii Backup Fusion](wii-backups#using-wii-backup-fusion) can do this for you, and will automatically set up the game directory structure correctly.

## USB Loader GX

### Requirements

- A Wii
- The latest version of [cIOS](cios)
- [USB Loader GX](https://github.com/wiidev/usbloadergx/releases)

### Installation

1. Ensure that your Wii already has cIOS 248-251 installed - this can be checked with applications like [SysChecker](syscheck) or d2x cIOS installer.
2. Download USB Loader GX and install it on your SD Card or USB device.

### „ÇØ„Ç§„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Éà„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ

#### Âü∫Êú¨

- If USB Loader GX says "Waiting for HDD..." with a 20 second countdown, it is very likely that it cannot detect your USB device. Try to exit out of the app, ensure your USB device is plugged into the bottom port if Wii is placed horizontally, or the port closest to the edge when the Wii is placed vertically. It may also be formatted incorrectly. Ensure that your USB drive is formatted to FAT32, with the MBR partition table, and 32kb (32768 bytes) allocation unit size/cluster size.
- You can press the 1 Button on your Wii Remote to open up a dialog to download game covers and artwork from [GameTDB](https://gametdb.com/). It might take a while to download the game covers and artwork, depending the amount of games you have.
- GameCube or "custom" Wii games may or may not have a custom banner that USB Loader GX uses. To enable this, find or write `CustomBannersURL = http://banner.rc24.xyz/` in `config/GXGlobal.cfg` on the drive you installed the app on. Then, you can use the `Custom Banner` download by pressing the 1 Button on your Wii Remote.

#### User Interface

On the middle of the bottom of the screen, you can see how much space is free on your USB drive and how many games you have.

These are the functions of the buttons found on the bar at the top of the screen, from left to right:

- Star - Shows games that you have marked as "favorites".
- Search - Lets you search for games by name.
- Sort - Cycles through sorting methods for games.
- Platform - Sorts games by platform.
- Category - Sorts games by category.
- List - Shows games in a list view.
- Multi-Cover View - Shows games in a multi-cover view.
- Cover Carousel View - Shows games in a carousel view.
- Wii Menu View - Shows games in a Wii Menu view.
- Parental Control - Locks USB Loader GX.
- Disc - Loads a game that is in the disc drive.

There are also other buttons at the bottom of the screen:

- (+) Icon - "Install" a game, i.e. loading it from disc and dumping it to your preset storage device.
- Gears - Global settings for USB Loader GX.
- SD card - Remount the SD card.
- Homebrew - Load homebrew apps.
- Wii - Open the HOME Menu.
- Power Button - Turn off your Wii.

## Troubleshooting

Some games require using a specific cIOS to function, or to utilize certain features within the game.
Examples include:

- Using a keyboard in Animal Crossing: City Folk.
- Running SpongeBob's Boating Bash.
- Using a USB dongle in Rock Band.

A more comprehensive (although still incomplete) list can be found [here](https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/Wii_cIOS_base_Compatibility_List).

Both USB Loader GX and WiiFlow Lite are programmed to automatically find the best cIOS to use and load the game with it using the default settings.  However, if for whatever reason these loaders pick the wrong cios to use, you have the option to change it yourself.

To change the cIOS used for a specific game, follow the instructions specific to your USB loader:

### USB Loader GX

1. Select the game that isn't working.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select `Game Load`.
4. Scroll down to `Game IOS`.
5. Enter the IOS slot to use.
 - Try using 248, 249, 250 or 251.
6. Press OK and try to load the game.

### http://www.wiithemer.org/

1. Select the game that isn't working.
2. Click the gear icon.
3. Go to cIOS and use the arrows to select the IOS slot to use.
 - Try using 248, 249, 250 or 251.
4. Press Save and try to load the game.
