The [Open Shop Channel](https://oscwii.org/) is a homebrew app repository created by dhtdht020, and is currently the preferred way to download homebrew.

There are two methods to use the Open Shop Channel: on your Wii through Homebrew Browser, or outside of your Wii through OSCDL.

## Method I - Homebrew Browser

### Requirements

- A homebrewed Wii with an active Internet connection
- an SD card or USB drive
- [Homebrew Browser](https://oscwii.org/library/app/homebrew_browser)

### Instructions

1. Download the recommended `.zip` file from the Open Shop Channel website.

2. Extract the `apps` folder in the archive to the root of your SD card or USB drive. Optionally, the archive also comes with a guide on how to use the Homebrew Browser.

3. Insert your SD card or USB drive into your Wii, and go to the Homebrew Channel. Homebrew Browser should now display.

## Method II - OSCDL

### Requirements

- A Windows/macOS/Linux computer with an internet connection
- an SD card or USB drive
- The latest version of [OSCDL](https://github.com/dhtdht020/osc-dl/releases/latest)

### Instructions for Windows

1. Download `oscdl-installer.exe` and run the installer. Optionally, you may instead download `oscdl-standalone.exe`, which does not have to be installed and instead runs as a portable executable.

2. If you get a User Account Control pop-up that asks whether or not you would like the program to make changes to your PC, select Yes. Open Shop Channel is a safe application.

3. Let the installer run, and then launch OSCDL once the process is finished.

4. Find an application that you would like to get, and press the Download button. Alternatively, you can send the app directly to your Wii (this requires that your computer and Wii be on the same network).

5. A `.zip` file containing your app should download to wherever you specified the directory to be. Extract the `apps` folder in this archive to the root of your SD card or USB drive.

6. Insert your SD card or USB drive into your Wii, and go to the Homebrew Channel. Your downloaded piece of homebrew should now display.

### Instructions for macOS/Linux
