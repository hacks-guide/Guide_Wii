Homebrew that has the ability to make permanant changes to your Wii are highlighted in **bold**.

## Utilities

- [**YAWM ModMii Edition**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/yawmME) - An extensively supported WAD manager with additional features. Recommended over any other WAD manager due to its extensive anti-brick protection.
- [SysCheck ModMii Edition](https://oscwii.org/library/app/SysCheckME) - A homebrew application which checks information about your Wii and pastes it back in a readable, sendable format. Think of it like a "System Information" app but for the Wii.
- [**CDBackup**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/cdbackup) - Backup, restore, and delete Wii Message Board data.
- [**AnyRegion Changer ME**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/ARCME) - ModMii edition of AnyRegion Changer. While a powerful tool for changing region settings, it can also lead to severe bricks like [Korean Kii/Error 003](bricks#koreankii-error-003-brick) so **only use this app if you know what you are doing**.
- [**WiiXplorer-SS**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/wiixplorer-ss) - A modified and updated version of WiiXplorer. A file manager for the Wii, it allows you to view and customize files both on an SD card, a USB device, and the internal Wii memory. For this reason it is a very powerful but also dangerous tool - don't modify files on the system NAND unless you know what you are doing, as it can lead to various types of [bricks](bricks).
- [**SaveGame Manager GX**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/SaveGame_Manager_GX) - A savegame/Mii extractor for the Wii. It supports GameCube memory cards (physical and virtual), emuNANDs, normal and protected saves, themes, and more.
- [**csm-installer**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/csm-installer) - An application that allows you to theme the Wii Menu. While quite useful to make your Wii unique, it also has the ability to cause a [minor brick](bricks#theme-brick), so make sure to read our [theme guide](themes) for safe usage instructions.
- [CleanRip](https://oscwii.org/library/app/CleanRip) - A tool to backup GameCube and Wii discs. Further information can be found in our [disc dumping guide](dump-games).
- [**d2x cIOS installer**](https://oscwii.org/library/app/d2x-cios-installer) - A custom installer for Wii IOS, some of which is required for the functioning of certain software like USB loaders. You can see the guide [here](cios).

- [CTGP-R](https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/download/) - A hefty mod of Mario Kart Wii that adds over **200** new tracks to the game. Requires a retail Mario Kart Wii game disc to run, independent of Riivolution.
