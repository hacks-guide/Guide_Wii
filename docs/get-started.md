# Get Started

If your Wii is already softmodded and you would like to update the softmods, follow [this](hackmii) guide to upgrade your setup.

All of the exploits listed here are different methods of achieving the same end-result (getting to the HackMii installer).

::: info

It is recommended to at least have an SD card on hand after the initial hack process, as this will enable you to make a NAND backup using BootMii and install many types of homebrew.
